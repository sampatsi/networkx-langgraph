```
I have a NetworkX + LangGraph demo project for building optimized agent systems. 

Please read all files in the project directory and give me:

1. A comprehensive overview of what this project does
2. The key files I should understand first
3. Three interesting insights you found
4. Three questions I should ask you next to learn more

Then wait for my next question.
```

### Then Use Any of 50+ Prompts

**Examples:**

**For Deep Understanding:**
```
Analyze phase1_networkx_design/02_bottleneck_analysis.py and explain:
1. What is betweenness centrality and why does it matter?
2. How does the algorithm identify bottlenecks?
3. Walk me through the code step-by-step with examples.
```

**For Customization:**
```
I want to adapt this for a RAG system with:
- Document retriever
